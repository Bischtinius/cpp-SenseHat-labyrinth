# cpp-SenseHat-labyrinth

A labyrinth game programmed for my studies at UAS Technikum Wien (FH Technikum Wien)

## Rules and Gameplay

- At the programm start a random Start Point is choosen and beginning from that a level is generated.
- When the pink target point appears it is possible to move toward it.
- If the target is reacht a new level is generated.
- A movement onto an impossible field (wall or outside the board) leads to an lost life.
- the player only has 3 lifes. The brightness of the player LED shows the health.

## Hardware

- RaspberryPi with SenseHat
- all nessecary libarys installed. (I have no idea which one exactly).
